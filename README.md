A composite GitHub Action that runs the
[zizmor](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor) static security auditor
against a repository's GitHub Actions workflows. It downloads a verified,
attested zizmor binary, audits the workspace in SARIF mode, writes a
findings summary, and publishes the SARIF to code scanning on request.

SARIF mode makes zizmor exit zero, so the audit stays advisory and does
not block merges. A code scanning ruleset can promote findings to
merge-blocking later.

Deploy it across an estate from one place — an organisation required
workflow — or opt in per repository with a short caller workflow.

The action runs on Linux and macOS runners, on x86_64 or arm64. On
other platforms it fails fast with a clear error.

## Usage

### Run the action

Check out the repository, then run the action as a step:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD046 -->

```yaml
jobs:
  zizmor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write
    steps:
      # yamllint disable-line rule:line-length
      - uses: actions/checkout@<commit-sha>  # v6
      # yamllint disable-line rule:line-length
      - uses: lfreleng-actions/zizmor-scan-action@<commit-sha>  # vX.Y.Z
        with:
          upload-sarif: 'true'
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 MD046 -->

Grant `security-events: write` and set `upload-sarif` to `'true'` to
publish results to code scanning. Drop both to keep the run advisory.
Pin the action to a commit SHA (the organisation standard) and record
the version in a trailing comment.

### Deploy across an organisation

Copy [`examples/required-workflow.yaml`](examples/required-workflow.yaml)
into your organisation's `.github` repository and reference it from an
organisation ruleset as a required workflow. GitHub then runs it across
every selected repository with no per-repository file. The audit job
holds `contents: read`; a separate job uploads the SARIF under
`security-events: write` on default-branch pushes.

### Opt in per repository

Copy [`examples/caller-workflow.yaml`](examples/caller-workflow.yaml)
into a repository's `.github/workflows/` directory. The single job audits
the repository on pull requests and uploads the SARIF on default-branch
pushes.

## How it works

1. The runner checks the action out at the ref a consumer pins. The
   action reads its pinned zizmor version from its bundled
   `pyproject.toml` through `${{ github.action_path }}`, so that ref
   fixes the zizmor version: the ref is the pin.
2. The action downloads the matching zizmor release binary from the
   [zizmorcore/zizmor releases](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor/releases)
   and verifies its Sigstore provenance with `gh attestation verify`
   before it runs. A binary that fails verification aborts the run.
3. zizmor audits the workspace in SARIF mode.
4. The action writes a findings summary to the job summary and emits
   inline annotations.
5. When `upload-sarif` is `'true'`, the action publishes the SARIF to
   code scanning. The example workflows set this for default-branch
   pushes and keep pull request runs advisory.

| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `persona`           | `auditor`       | zizmor persona controlling finding breadth: `regular`, `pedantic`, or `auditor`.      |
| `min-severity`      | `informational` | Lowest severity reported: `unknown`, `informational`, `low`, `medium`, `high`.        |
| `min-confidence`    | `""`            | Lowest confidence reported: `low`, `medium`, or `high`. Empty audits all confidences. |
| `working-directory` | `.`             | Path within the workspace to audit.                                                   |
| `zizmor-version`    | `""`            | Override the bundled pin with an explicit tag (for example `v1.25.2`).                |
| `extra-args`        | `""`            | Extra raw arguments appended to the zizmor call.                                      |
| `upload-sarif`      | `'false'`       | Publish SARIF to code scanning from the action: `'true'` or `'false'`.                |

## Outputs

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Name         | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sarif-file` | Absolute path to the generated SARIF file.   |

## Permissions

Grant these to the calling job:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Permission               | Why                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `contents: read`         | Check out the repository under audit.                                    |
| `security-events: write` | Publish SARIF to code scanning when `upload-sarif` is `true`.            |
| `actions: read`          | Lets `upload-sarif` read run info on private repos (harmless on public). |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The action uses the automatically provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` and needs no
extra secrets.

## Version management

`pyproject.toml` pins the zizmor version and `uv.lock` locks it.
Dependabot's `uv` ecosystem watches these files and opens a pull request
when a new zizmor release ships. The lock file gives Dependabot the
resolution context it needs, so version and security updates resolve
cleanly.

The update flow:

1. zizmor publishes a new release.
2. Dependabot opens a pull request bumping `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
   (weekly, with a cooldown so fresh releases settle first).
3. A maintainer reviews and merges the bump.
4. A maintainer pushes a signed semver tag; the release-drafter and
   tag-push workflows draft and promote the GitHub release.
5. Consuming repositories bump their pinned ref (through their own
   Dependabot `github-actions` updates) to adopt the new zizmor version.

## Security model

- **Provenance verification.** Every run downloads the zizmor release
  binary and verifies its Sigstore attestation with
  `gh attestation verify --repo zizmorcore/zizmor` before it runs.
- **Pinned and reviewable.** The ref a consumer pins fixes the installed
  zizmor version. Upgrades arrive as reviewable pull requests rather than
  tracking the latest release automatically.
- **SHA pinning.** Consumers pin this action, and the action pins
  everything it uses, to commit SHAs.
- **Least privilege.** The example workflows audit under `contents: read`
  and upload the SARIF from a job that holds `security-events: write`.
